### **[Fake news detection](https://github.com/nguyen-nhat-mai/fake-news-detection)**

The task is to employ traditional machine learning (ML) classification methods to mine the text and identify unreliable news. The dataset comprises 26,000 rows representing fake and reliable news. For each article, title, text, author and label are provided. ML methods employed are Support vector machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistics regression, Knn and Decision tree. The performances of models are evaluated using accuracy score and running time. Naive Bayes proves to outperform in this case with 84% accuracy score and the least running time i.e. 0.11 seconds.

### **[Satellite image semantic segmentation](https://github.com/nguyen-nhat-mai/satellite-image-semantic-segmentation)**

The task is to employ deep learning to segment and classify the objects (26 labels) in the satellite images. The dataset comprises 374 images (3x3000x4000) of residential neighborhoods in Houston after the hurricane Harvey. 299 out of the total images have corresponding masks which are used for training deep learning models. The masks for the remaining 75 images are to be predicted. U-net, PSPNet & Deeplabv3 are employed and evaluated using dice score and cross entrophy loss. Deeplabv3 outperformed with 72.65% accuracy and 0.6 loss.
