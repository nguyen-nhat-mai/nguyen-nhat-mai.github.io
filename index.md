### **[Fake news detection](https://github.com/nguyen-nhat-mai/fake-news-detection)**

For this project, traditional machine learning (ML) classification methods were employed to mine the text and identify unreliable news. The dataset comprises 44,898 rows representing fake and reliable news. For each news, article title, text, type and the date the article was published on are provided. The majority of the news focus on political and world news topics. ML methods employed are Naive Bayes, Logistics Regression, Knn, Decision Tree. The performances of models were evaluated using accuracy score and running time. Decision Tree proved to outperform in this case.

### **[Satellite image semantic segmentation](https://github.com/nguyen-nhat-mai/satellite-image-semantic-segmentation)**

The task was to employ deep learning to segment and classify the objects (26 labels) in the satellite images. The dataset comprises 374 images (3x3000x4000) of residential neighborhoods in Houston after the hurricane Harvey. 299 out of the total images have corresponding masks which were used for training deep learning models (U-net, PSPNet, Deeplabv3). The competition requires the submission of the masks for the remaining 75 images. Deeplabv3 got the best accuracy of xxx.
